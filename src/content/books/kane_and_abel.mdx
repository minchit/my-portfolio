## ðŸ’­ Personal Reflection
I first read this book in **Myanmar translation by Mg Tun Thu**. I loved how it **illuminated the historical and economic realities** of the U.S. and Europe during that era. Since it became **one of my all-time favorites**, I later challenged myself to **read the original English version**, further deepening my appreciation for its storytelling.
