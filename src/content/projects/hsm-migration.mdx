## What do Hardware Security Modules (HSM) do
"A [hardware security module (HSM)](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules/payment-hsms/payshield-10k) is a dedicated crypto processor that is specifically designed for the protection of the crypto key lifecycle. Hardware security modules act as trust anchors that protect the cryptographic infrastructure of some of the most security-conscious organizations in the world by securely managing, processing, and storing cryptographic keys inside a hardened, tamper-resistant device."
<br/>

**`Challenge`**

A financial institution needed to migrate its existing Hardware Security Module (HSM) from SafeNet to Thales 10K to enhance security, meet compliance requirements, and replace outdated SafeNet hardware.

**`My Contribution`**

	•	Assisted in the development of new binary files compatible with Thales 10K cryptography.

	•	Configured and tested encryption keys and secure API transactions.

	•	Ensured all integrations were updated, validated, and aligned with strict security policies.


**`Outcome`**

	•	Successfully migrated HSM with zero transaction failures.

	•	Achieved full compliance with the latest security standards.

	•	Improved cryptographic processing efficiency and system security.
