"Without proper certification, a payment system can’t process transactions for VISA and Mastercard. This project was a deep dive into international payment compliance, with security audits and stress tests pushing our system to its limits."
<br/>

**`Challenge`**

Passing all certification tests without delays—one failed test could set the entire project back by weeks. Ensuring all transactions met the strictest security and operational requirements was a non-negotiable.

	•	Led the certification process, coordinating between internal teams and VISA/Mastercard.

	•	Conducted API security and compliance testing.

	•	Implemented required cryptographic updates.


**`Outcome`**

	•	Successfully passed certification, unlocking VISA/Mastercard transaction processing.

	•	Strengthened the platform’s security for future enhancements.
