"Telecom operators rely on Business Support Systems (BSS) to handle billing, CRM, and customer interactions. My role was to keep these systems running smoothly while optimizing performance."
<br/>

**`Challenge`**

A system bug was causing prepaid customers’ bonus credits to be deducted from their main balance instead of their promotional balance. If unresolved, this could result in mass customer complaints and revenue loss.

**`My Contribution`**

	•	Handled incident management and root cause analysis.

	•	Performed system upgrades and performance tuning.

	•	Ensured high availability of billing and CRM platforms.


**`Outcome`**

	•	Issue resolved before large-scale customer impact.
  
	•	System stability improved with better monitoring.
