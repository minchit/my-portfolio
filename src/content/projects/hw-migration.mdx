"A financial institution decided to migrate its mission-critical banking applications from Oracle Sun Solaris to VM Red Hat Linux. This transition was essential for performance improvements, cost optimization, and future scalability. However, ensuring a seamless migration without any disruption to financial transactions was the real challenge."
<br/>

**`Challenge`**

In a banking environment, even the slightest discrepancy in functionality can have major consequences. During the migration, we had to meticulously track every binary file change, validate compatibility across system components, and ensure there was zero functional loss. Any misalignment could cause transaction failures, security vulnerabilities, or data inconsistencies.

**`My Contribution`**

	•	Tracked and validated all changes in binary files, ensuring consistency across different versions.

	•	Performed rigorous system testing, including regression testing, to ensure every functionality worked as expected post-migration.

	•	Coordinated with developers, DBAs, and system engineers to ensure seamless middleware and application compatibility.

	•	Monitored system logs before and after migration to detect any irregularities.


**`Outcome`**

	•	Migration was successfully completed with no discrepancies in banking transactions.

	•	System performance improved, leading to better efficiency and scalability.
	
	•	Strengthened infrastructure resilience, reducing dependency on legacy hardware.
