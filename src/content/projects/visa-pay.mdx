"A local mobile wallet provider wanted to expand its services by integrating VISA virtual cards, allowing users to transact globally. The challenge? Ensuring secure, seamless transactions while navigating VISA’s strict compliance requirements."
<br/>

**`Challenge`**

The payment app was never designed to handle international transactions. We had to integrate VISA’s APIs, implement strong encryption, and pass multiple certification rounds—all while ensuring a smooth user experience."

**`My Contribution`**

	•	Led the integration of VISA’s APIs into the local payment application, ensuring compliance with VISA security protocols.

	•	Configured transaction authorization, card provisioning, and tokenization processes.

	•	Conducted extensive testing, including functional, security, and certification tests required for VISA approval.

	•	Collaborated with VISA representatives and the local payment service provider to align technical requirements.


**`Outcome`**

	•	Successfully enabled VISA virtual card transactions within the local payment app.

	•	Ensured full compliance with VISA certification requirements, passing all security and transaction integrity checks.

	•	Expanded the payment app’s usability, allowing users to transact globally with VISA.
