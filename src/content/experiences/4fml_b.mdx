## Summary
"When my family needs, I worked at printing house—handling everything from customer service to operations. It was less about coding and more about managing machines, logistics, and client relationships. And yes, dealing with angry customers when orders were delayed was part of the job!"
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Managed customer service and sales, ensuring client orders were fulfilled on time.

	•	Oversaw daily operations, from supply chain logistics to managing print schedules.

	•	Handled inventory and procurement of printing materials and equipment.

	•	Assisted with basic accounting and financial tracking.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"During peak seasons, our machines were running non-stop, and the challenge wasn’t just printing—it was managing the supply chain to avoid running out of ink, paper, or maintenance time for the machines."

**`What I Learned`**

	•	Customer service and crisis management—because customers don’t like excuses.

	•	How to balance operations, logistics, and deadlines.
    
	•	That running a business means solving problems daily—whether in tech or printing.
