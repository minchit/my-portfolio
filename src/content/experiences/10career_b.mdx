*On-site / Yangon*

## Summary
"Technology is evolving rapidly, and I knew that sticking to on-premise infrastructure alone wouldn’t future-proof my career. My background in FinTech, Telecom, and large-scale IT operations gave me deep expertise in troubleshooting and maintaining critical systems, but I wanted to move beyond that—toward cloud automation and data engineering. That’s why, in March 2024, I relocated to Thailand to gain hands-on experience with cloud-first, scalable architectures."

**`From Stability to Growth: Why I Took the Leap`**

"BPC gave me incredible experience in financial systems and payment processing, but my role shifted to primarily supporting Myanmar’s banking sector, while BPC’s regional teams managed their own banking support. This limited my ability to work on cloud-native architectures or automation projects.

Additionally, Myanmar’s infrastructure instability made learning cloud and DevOps methodologies nearly impossible. Power outages, slow connectivity, and on-premise-only banking environments restricted access to modern tools. Since remote work wasn’t feasible for my role, relocating to Thailand became the best choice to advance my career in cloud and data engineering."
