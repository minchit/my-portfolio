## Summary
“I thought I was just joining as a database developer, but turns out, I was working in the heart of a telecom billing system. From handling massive data migrations to writing stored procedures that calculated customer bills, I realized that one misplaced SQL join could turn into a nationwide billing crisis!"
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Developed PL/SQL stored procedures and triggers for telecom billing calculations.

	•	Optimized ETL processes to ensure smooth data movement across multiple systems.

	•	Migrated and validated large datasets during system upgrades and transitions.

	•	Debugged billing discrepancies, ensuring customers weren’t over- or undercharged.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"During a billing cycle, a key stored procedure was causing severe performance degradation, delaying invoice generation. After investigation, I discovered that frequent joins on large tables with millions of records were leading to full-table scans. The issue? Missing indexes and inefficient query logic. By restructuring the query, adding appropriate indexes, and optimizing table partitions, I reduced execution time from over an hour to just a few seconds—ensuring billing ran smoothly and on schedule."

**`What I Learned`**

	•	Data accuracy is everything in telecom billing—one wrong query can cause billing chaos.

	•	SQL performance tuning is a lifesaver, especially when working with millions of records.

	•	How data migrations and ETL processes are managed in real-world enterprise applications.
