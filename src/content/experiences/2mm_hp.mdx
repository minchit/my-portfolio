## Summary
"I joined as a developer, but quickly found myself leading a team to build a medical inventory and sales system from scratch. From coding backend logic to ensuring doctors and pharmacists could track medicine stocks in real time, I got to see how technology makes healthcare operations smoother."
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Designed and developed a medicine inventory management system.

	•	Implemented real-time stock tracking, ensuring expiry control.

	•	Integrated sales, stock, and reporting modules into a unified system.

	•	Led a small team of developers, managing project timelines and feature rollouts.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"Imagine multiple pharmacists processing sales at the same time—but the system wasn’t handling stock updates correctly, 
leading to double sales on the same item. Fixing it required implementing database locking mechanisms and real-time inventory updates."

**`What I Learned`**

	•	How to design scalable inventory and sales systems.

	•	The importance of data integrity in stock management.

	•	How to lead a development team while managing project constraints.
