*On-site / Yangon*

## Summary
“Telecom billing? Sounds easy, right? Wrong. If banks process transactions, telecoms process millions of calls, SMS, and data charges every second. When I joined Huawei, I quickly realized that even a tiny billing error could cost an operator millions. No pressure.”
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Provided L2 support for telecom billing systems, ensuring customers weren’t over- or undercharged.

	•	Investigated billing discrepancies, ensuring prepaid and postpaid plans worked correctly.

	•	Performed root cause analysis on failed transactions, working closely with multiple vendors.

    •	Configured and Launch the tariff and telecom products.

	•	Monitored system stability and ensured zero downtime for mission-critical billing services.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

“A customer complained that despite having an active data package and promotional free balance, charges were incorrectly deducted from their main balance. After analyzing billing logs and rating engine behavior, I discovered that the system was failing to prioritize available resources before deducting from the main balance. The root cause? A misconfigured charging rule in the billing logic. I worked with the operator’s team to patch the configuration and ensure resource prioritization was handled correctly—preventing further customer dissatisfaction and revenue miscalculations."

**`What I Learned`**

	•	How telecom billing works behind the scenes, from call data records (CDRs) to rating engines.

	•	That small system bugs can cost millions—and how to prevent them.

	•	The art of troubleshooting complex billing workflows under high-pressure conditions.

	•	How to coordinate with multiple teams (network, IT, finance) to resolve issues.
