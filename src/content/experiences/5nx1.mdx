[NEXSYS-ONE](https://www.nexsysone.com/modules/)

*Hybrid / Yangon*

## Summary
“I joined Nexsysone thinking it was a normal database admin role. What I actually got was managing a telecom rollout project, tracking thousands of site deployments, and ensuring data consistency in a complex network of telecom towers. It was like running a live GPS tracker for an entire country’s telecom expansion.”
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Managed telecom rollout data, ensuring accurate tracking of site deployments.

	•	Optimized database queries and ETL processes to improve system performance.

	•	Provided reports for project managers and regional telecom operators.

	•	Maintained data integrity across multiple telecom systems (ProjectOne, AccessOne).

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"During a critical hardware migration, we restored the database from backup and reconfigured replication in MySQL. However, one crucial step was overlooked—we forgot to disable replication on one side. The result? A never-ending replication loop, causing data to sync back and forth endlessly. After a frantic investigation, we identified the issue, disabled unnecessary replication, and successfully stabilized the system. Lesson learned: Always double-check replication settings before going live!"

**`What I Learned`**

	•	How telecom rollout projects are managed and tracked.

	•	That data accuracy is critical for real-world decision-making.

	•	Advanced SQL performance tuning for large-scale reporting.

	•	How to collaborate with engineers, PMs, and field teams for accurate project tracking.
