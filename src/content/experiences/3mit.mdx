*On-site / Yangon* 

## Summary
"A brief but insightful dive into system administration—coordinating with Oracle developers, patching OS and databases, and ensuring banking systems stayed operational. It wasn’t the most exciting role, but it gave me a solid understanding of IT in the financial sector."
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

• Coordinated with Oracle Developers for system updates and troubleshooting.

• Installed and patched Linux OS (Red Hat, Solaris) and Oracle databases.

• Performed basic system maintenance on Oracle FLEXCUBE banking software.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"A routine OS patch turned into a high-stakes operation when a minor update unexpectedly caused service disruption. While troubleshooting, I learned that even small changes in a banking environment require meticulous planning and rollback strategies."

**`What I Learned`**

• The importance of system stability in financial institutions.

• Basic Oracle database administration and system patching procedures.

• That sometimes, a job isn’t the right fit—so I moved on to help with my family business.
