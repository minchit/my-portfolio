*On-site / Yangon*

## Summary
"My first full-time IT role, where I juggled IT peripherals, networking, system administration, and even web development. Basically, if something had a plug or an IP address, I was responsible for it."
<br/>

**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Managed IT infrastructure, including networking, servers, and security.

	•	Developed and maintained internal business applications.

	•	Handled CCTV, PBX (Phone Systems), and network configurations.

	•	Assisted in website development for the company.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

"One day, the entire office lost internet—everyone panicked, and as always, IT was the first suspect. I rushed to check the network and found something unusual: an unplugged network cable had been ‘helpfully’ reconnected by someone… to the wrong place. The other end was still plugged in, creating a network loop that took down the entire office connectivity. It was a classic case of ‘helping’ gone wrong. The lesson? Never underestimate human curiosity and always check for simple network misconfigurations before blaming the ISP!"

**`What I Learned`**

	•	How to manage a diverse IT environment—networking, systems, and applications.

	•	The value of documentation (because fixing undocumented systems is a nightmare).

	•	How to keep calm under pressure when IT problems arise.
