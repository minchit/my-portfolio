## Summary
"Stepping into the startup world, I initially planned to invest and contribute to the company’s growth, leveraging both my technical and business knowledge. However, with the unexpected political crisis in Myanmar, I had to reconsider. Despite only spending a short time there, I gained valuable insights into startup operations, product strategy, and business challenges—learning that launching a business in an unstable economy is just as unpredictable as debugging a system outage!"
