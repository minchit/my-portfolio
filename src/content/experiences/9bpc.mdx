*Remote-Hybrid / APAC Region*

## How It Started
“As an Implementation Engineer, I made sure that payment transactions didn’t get lost in the digital void. 
I worked with SmartVista payment solutions, configuring and deploying banking systems that process millions of transactions daily – and yes, every time you swipe your card, I’d like to think a small part of my work made that possible.”


<br/>
**`What I Actually Did`**

	•	Configured, deployed, and supported SmartVista payment solutions for banks across APAC.

	•	Worked on Visa, Mastercard, and UnionPay integrations, ensuring seamless transactions.

	•	Troubleshot failed transactions, investigating API calls, logs, and system workflows.

	•	Performed HSM (Hardware Security Module) migrations, ensuring banks stayed compliant with security standards.

	•	Supported real-time transaction processing to make sure customer payments weren’t lost in the void.

**`Biggest Challenge?`**

“One of the biggest challenges I faced was during a major banking event when transaction failures spiked unexpectedly. Payment transaction were getting failed randomly, and customers were seeing deductions without confirmations—an absolute nightmare for a financial institution. I led the investigation, analyzing transaction logs and tracing the failures back to an unoptimized database query that couldn’t handle peak loads. After coordinating with developers and applying a fix, transactions stabilized, and the issue never resurfaced. That experience taught me the importance of proactive performance testing and database efficiency.”

**`What I Learned`**

	•	How payment transactions work behind the scenes, from card swipes to bank authorizations.

	•	The importance of real-time monitoring in financial transactions.

	•	Managing high-pressure, high-impact issues with calmness and precision.

	•	Never underestimate the power of a well-documented log file and lesson-learend problems.
