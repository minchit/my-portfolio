    "A tech enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems, implementing scalable systems, and occasionally debugging myself after too much coffee. With a background in FinTech, Telecom, and Cloud Technologies, I’ve worked with enterprise-level applications, banking transactions, and telecom billing platforms. Whether it’s system deployments, troubleshooting mission-critical services, or making sense of logs that look like alien languages, I’m here for the challenge!",

  words: [
    "My tech journey began in the trenches of IT troubleshooting, where every issue felt urgent, and every fix had a countdown. Working with mission-critical systems, I tackled transaction failures in banking platforms, ensuring every payment processed correctly instead of disappearing into the void. In telecom, I safeguarded billing system stability, knowing that even a minute of downtime could mean massive revenue loss. Through it all, I quickly learned that technology loves to break—especially at 2 AM.",
    
    "Now, I’m diving into cloud computing (AWS & Azure), IoT, and data engineering—because ensuring systems run smoothly is just as important as building them to be resilient from the start. My goal? To bridge automation, scalability, and innovation while keeping ‘unexpected errors’ where they belong—in my logs, not in production.",
